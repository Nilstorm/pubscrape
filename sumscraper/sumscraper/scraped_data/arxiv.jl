There has been considerable work\non studying these theories compactified on a small circle (with\ncompactification scale 1/L large relative to the strong coupling scale of the\ntheory). The weakly coupled IR theory of photons exhibits confinement through a\ndensity of magnetically charged instanton configurations. As the\ncompactification scale 1/L approaches the strong coupling scale, the IR theory\nbecomes strongly coupled. In this regime we propose a holographic description\nof the IR degrees of freedom. The instanton condensation scale can be\nassociated with a scale at which the Brietenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound is\nviolated in the model and the glueball spectrum computed. We can also introduce\nthe adjoint fermions which holographically display a BF bound violation\nassociated to their running anomalous dimension. Very naively extending the\nperturbative results to the non-perturbative regime suggests that chiral\nsymmetry breaking might occur ahead of confinement, but equally they may be\njoined phenomena. If the two phenomena are separate, then it would be useful to\nbe able to enlarge the gap in scales. We propose adding fermions in the\nfundamental representation as well, which in a holographic model (that favours\nthis separation) can greatly enlarge the gap to an order of magnitude.

A central decision in designing a Bayesian optimization campaign to\nguide experiments is the choice of a batch acquisition function when little or\nnothing is known about the landscape of the \"black box\" function to be\noptimized. To inform this decision, we first compare the performance of serial\nand Monte Carlo batch acquisition functions on two mathematical functions that\nserve as proxies for typical materials synthesis and processing experiments.\nThe two functions, both in six dimensions, are the Ackley function, which\nepitomizes a \"needle-in-haystack\" search, and the Hartmann function, which\nexemplifies a \"false optimum\" problem. Our study evaluates the serial upper\nconfidence bound with local penalization (UCB/LP) batch acquisition policy\nagainst Monte Carlo-based parallel approaches: q-log expected improvement\n(qlogEI) and q-upper confidence bound (qUCB), where q is the batch size. Tests\non Ackley and Hartmann show that UCB/LP and qUCB perform well in noiseless\nconditions, both outperforming qlogEI. For the Hartmann function with noise,\nall Monte Carlo functions achieve faster convergence with less sensitivity to\ninitial conditions compared to UCB/LP. We then confirm the findings on an\nempirical regression model built from experimental data in maximizing power\nconversion efficiency of flexible perovskite solar cells. Our results suggest\nthat when empirically optimizing a \"black-box\" function in less than or equal\nto six dimensions with no prior knowledge of the landscape or noise\ncharacteristics, qUCB is best suited as the default to maximize confidence in\nthe modeled optimum while minimizing the number of expensive samples needed.\n"}

We\ninvestigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide\nneedle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning\nstage.

Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of\none selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined\nreward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent\nthen moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple\nrounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached.\nPlan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for\ntesting) treated in our clinic were included in this study.

CADASIL is an inherited vascular disease that impairs\nblood flow in the small cerebral vessels of the brain, leading to strokes and\nother neurological deficits. The disease is caused by a mutation in the NOTCH3\ngene located on chromosome 19. NOTCH3 encodes a transmembrane receptor\nexpressed on vascular smooth muscle cells. In CADASIL, mutations in the NOTCH3\ngene lead to the accumulation and deposition of the receptor, affecting the\nnumber of cysteine residues in its extracellular domain. These mutations result\nin the loss or gain of a cysteine residue within the epidermal growth\nfactor-like repeat (EGFr) domains of the NOTCH protein. Beyond traditional\nsymptomatic treatments for stroke, this work highlights advances in disease\nmodifying approaches including gene editing, cell therapies, and immune-based\ninterventions aimed at altering the course of CADASIL. It also examines ongoing\nclinical trials and recent patents related to these novel strategies. In\naddition to summarizing diagnostic methods and molecular mechanisms, the\narticle emphasizes the translational potential of current research and the\nexperimental models driving therapeutic development. The goal is to offer a\ncomprehensive overview of CADASIL and emerging interventions that hold promise\nfor improving long-term outcomes.\n"}

While well-studied with single-timepoint data,\nstandard methods do not easily generalize to address non-baseline positivity\nviolations in longitudinal data, and remain vulnerable to such violations. In\nthis paper, we extend weighting and trimming to longitudinal data via\nstochastic ``flip'' interventions, which maintain the treatment status of\nsubjects who would have received the target treatment, and flip others'\ntreatment to the target with probability equal to their weight (e.g., overlap\nweight, trimming indicator). We first show, in single-timepoint data, that flip\ninterventions yield a large class of weighted average treatment effects,\nascribing a novel policy interpretation to these popular weighted estimands.\nWith longitudinal data, we then show that flip interventions provide\ninterpretable weighting or trimming on non-baseline covariates and, crucially,\nyield effects that are identifiable under arbitrary positivity violations.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that flip interventions are policy-relevant since they\ncould be implemented in practice. By contrast, we show that alternative\napproaches for weighting on non-baseline covariates fail to achieve this\nproperty. We derive flexible and efficient estimators based on efficient\ninfluence functions when the weight is a smooth function of the propensity\nscore. Namely, we construct multiply robust-style and sequentially doubly\nrobust-style estimators that achieve root-n consistency and asymptotic\nnormality under nonparametric conditions.

In some cases, this evolution is\nfurther influenced by the accretion of stellar debris, which modifies the\ndipole magnetic field strength. During a hypercritical accretion phase that\nlasts seconds or longer after the progenitor explosion, a thin crust may form,\nsubmerging the magnetic field (the so-called magnetic burial scenario). Once\nhypercritical accretion ceases, the buried field can diffuse back through the\ncrust, delaying the external dipole's reactivation. On the other hand,\nobservations have shown that relativistic outflows ejected by these objects and\ndecelerated by the circumburst environment cause a late and temporary emission\nknown as afterglow. This work investigates how the submergence and subsequent\nreemergence of the magnetar magnetic field, on a few years timescales, affect\nthe GRB afterglow dynamics. Specifically, we apply this phenomenological\nscenario to the late-time X-ray excess observed approximately three years\npost-burst in GW170817/GRB 170817A, exploring how the evolving magnetic field\nstrength may contribute to this emission. Our modelling of GRB 170817A\nindicates that $\\gtrsim90$ percent of the external dipole flux was initially\nburied, re-emerging on a timescale $\\tau_{B}=3-40$ yr and restoring a surface\nfield $B\\simeq(2-5)\\times10^{15}\\,$G; the late-time X-ray brightening is far\nbetter reproduced by this scenario than by models without burial.\n"}

In the MW, the uvB amplitude hB and wB do vary; however, such a\nnarrow bump has never been observed and no variability of lB has been\nconvincingly found. Recently, links have been found between both hB and wB and\nthe strength of several Diffuse Interstellar absorption Bands (DIBs).

We used the 5780 and 6284 A\nsigma, and 5797 and 5850 A zeta DIBs. Similarly to hB and wB, lB reacts to the\nabundance of sigma carriers and is insensitive to the abundance of zeta DIB\ncarriers, which dominate in dense cloud cores. A strong abundance of sigma\ncarriers induces a shift of lB to longer wavelengths and a decrease of wB.
